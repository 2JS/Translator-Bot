# Translator-Bot

Here you can find a personnal project I made and actually self-host. It is my own discord bot, made with discord.py, discord-interactions, googletrans, and sqlite3.

You are allowed to take the code and use it as you want.

If you hope this bot, you can vote for it on [TopGG Website](https://top.gg/bot/815328232537718794)
